        <p>Pipit was ideated by M.Rehberg and K.C.. Pipit is a word ladder game that has the following rules: </p>
            <ul class="rules-ul">
                <li>Goal: Make the first word turn into the last word by changing one letter at a time. </li>
                <li>Note 1: Letters are allowed to change location from one word to the next. </li>
                <li>Note 2: Guess "..." to reset. </li>
                <li>Note 3: Type "give up" to see an answer. </li>
                <li>Note 4: The "Paths" number represents how many shortest paths still remain to the end.</li> 
                <li>Note 5: Click or hover on a word to see its definition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Word ladders have been around for a while so the idea of this game is not new. However, the mathematics of word ladders have been out of computational reach until recent. It is these mathematics of Pipit that fascinated Mathius and Kerithstein. </p> 
            <ul class="about-ul">
                <li>There are 11,881,376 possible combinations of 5 letters.</li> 
                <li>Of those combinations, there are 6610 words recognized in the english language (0.0556%).</li>
                <li>Of the 6610 words, there are only 17 words are not connected to other words by 4/5 letters - meaning that they are not feasible options for a word ladder.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both pipit, <span class="p-def">{'Noun': ['a songbird that lives mainly on the ground in open country; has streaky brown plumage']}</span>, and pizza, <span class="p-def">{'Noun': ['Italian open pie made of thin bread dough spread with a spiced mixture of e.g. tomato sauce and cheese']}</span>, are of the 17 words that cannot be accessed via a word ladder.   </p>
